# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I've implemented the ui for desktop also.
And In my opinion, it needs to show distance or roads(car, bicycle, motorcycle) between current location and selected hub.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?


### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I've spents most of time to implement google map marker customize.
I've changed marker icon(circle image) but it takes some hours to make label.
because I've tried to make svg component for each markers.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I've implemented all requirements in ReadME.md
Tested all things one by one.
I suggest to show loading icon before get current location from GPS.
